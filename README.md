# CleverCare
One of the most common problems faced by today’s people is a lack of knowledge of diseases and a lack of immediate first aid consultation. Due to this many people 
may suffer from physical and mental stress as they try to figure out the reason for their condition. In some cases, they even lost their lives and common diseases 
become life-threatening. Now Virtual Health Assistant comes into action.
It is a web service in which the proposed system tries to eliminate users’ need to figure out their disease by giving them access to a centralized clinical
repository in a much interactive manner. Users can also ask questions regarding their disease and even book online and offline appointments with doctors.#
